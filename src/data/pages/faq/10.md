OpenEBS is currently tightly integrated into Kubernetes. Support for Docker Swarm is something we are looking at for the future

The system requirements depend on the number of volumes that are provisioned and can horizontally scale with the number of nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. The OpenEBS control plane comprises of a minimum of two pods - API server and dynamic provisioner. These can be run using 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs.

Each volume spins up the IO controller and replica pods. Each of these requires 1GB RAM and 0.5 CPU by default.

For enabling high-availability, the recommendation is to have a minimum of 3 nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

OpenEBS stores data in a configurable number of replicas. These are placed to maximize resiliency, so, for example, they are placed in different racks or availability zones.

To determine exactly where your data is physically stored, you can run the following kubectl commands:

a. Run kubectl get pvc to fetch the Volume name. The volume name looks like: `pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be`

b. For each volume, you will notice one IO controller pod and one or more replicas (as per the storage class configuration). For the above PVC, run the following command to get the IO controller and replica pods. `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be`. The output will show the following pods:

..- IO Controller: `pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-ctrl-6798475d8c-7dcqd`
..- Replica 1: `pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-rep-86f8b8c758-hls6s`
..- Replica 2: `pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-rep-86f8b8c758-tr28f`

c. To check the location where the data is stored, get the details of the replica pod. For getting the details of Replica 1 above, use the following command: `kubectl get pod -o yaml pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-rep-86f8b8c758-hls6s`

```
  Check for the volumes section:
```

```
  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/openebs/pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be
      type: ""
    name: openebs
```

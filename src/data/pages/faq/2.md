query: 'Why did you choose iSCSI? Doesnâ€™t it introduce latency and decrease performance?'

With OpenEBS, we strive to make it simple to use - using Kubernetes as much as possible to manage OpenEBS itself. iSCSI allows us to be more resilient in cases in which the workload and the controller are not on the same host. In other words, the OpenEBS user or architect will not suffer an outage in the case that the storage IO controller is not scheduled local to the workload in need of storage. OpenEBS does a variety of things to improve performance elsewhere in the stack - and much more is to come via the cStor storage engine - to be able to have this level of flexibility.

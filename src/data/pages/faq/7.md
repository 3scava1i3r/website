If you have a Kubernetes environment, you can deploy OpenEBS with:

```
  kubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/openebs-operator.yaml
```

Users often begin by then running a workload against OpenEBS. There are a large and growing number of workloads that have storage classes that use OpenEBS. You do not need to use these specific storage classes; however, they may be helpful as they save time and allow for per workload customization. You should join the Slack channel at: [https://openebs-community.slack.com](https://openebs-community.slack.com)

One of the significant differences between OpenEBS versus other similar approaches is that no changes are required to run OpenEBS on Kubernetes. However, OpenEBS itself is a workload, and the easy management of it is crucial, mainly as the Container Attached Storage approach entails putting containers that are IO controller and replica controllers.

OpenEBS IO controller can be accessed via iSCSI, exposed as a Service. The nodes will need to have an iSCSI initiator installed. In case the kubelet is running in a container like in the case of Rancher, etc., the iSCSI initiator should be installed within the kubelet container.

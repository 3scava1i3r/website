query: 'How about performance? How does OpenEBS perform?'
---

OpenEBS has been engineered not to require any changes to the containers on which it runs. Similarly, Kubernetes itself does not need to be altered, and no additional external orchestrator is required. However, the workloads that need storage do need to be running on hosts that have iSCSI initiators, which is a default configuration in almost all operating systems.

#### What changes need to be made to the containers on which OpenEBS runs?

Performance tests on the current release v.0.5.2 show acceptable performance, but additional efforts are ongoing to improve performance. OpenEBS will soon implement a variety of changes to improve performance elsewhere in the stack - and much more is to come via the cStor storage engine.
